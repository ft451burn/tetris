# Collision Detection Fixes for Tetris Game

## Problem Statement
The original game had incorrect collision detection causing pieces to behave improperly when moving, rotating, or placing.

## Key Collision Detection Improvements

### 1. **Robust `isCollision()` Function**
```javascript
isCollision(piece, x, y) {
    for (let row = 0; row < piece.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < piece[row].length; col++) {
            if (piece[row][col]) {
                const newX = x + col;
                const newY = y + row;
                
                // Check boundary collisions
                if (newX < 0 || newX >= this.boardWidth || newY >= this.boardHeight) {
                    return true;
                }
                
                // Check collision with existing pieces (only if within bounds)
                if (newY >= 0 && this.board[newY][newX]) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Key fixes:**
- ✅ Proper boundary checking (left, right, bottom)
- ✅ Only checks collision with existing pieces when `newY >= 0` (prevents errors when piece is spawning above board)
- ✅ Checks each individual block of the piece, not just the piece origin

### 2. **Rotation with Wall Kicks**
The rotation system now includes "wall kicks" - if a piece can't rotate in place, it tries to move left or right to accommodate the rotation:

```javascript
rotate() {
    const rotated = this.rotatePiece(this.currentPiece.shape);
    
    // Try to place rotated piece at current position
    if (!this.isCollision(rotated, this.currentX, this.currentY)) {
        this.currentPiece.shape = rotated;
        return;
    }
    
    // Try wall kicks (move left/right to accommodate rotation)
    for (let offset = 1; offset <= 2; offset++) {
        // Try moving right
        if (!this.isCollision(rotated, this.currentX + offset, this.currentY)) {
            this.currentPiece.shape = rotated;
            this.currentX += offset;
            return;
        }
        // Try moving left
        if (!this.isCollision(rotated, this.currentX - offset, this.currentY)) {
            this.currentPiece.shape = rotated;
            this.currentX -= offset;
            return;
        }
    }
    
    // If all wall kicks fail, don't rotate
}
```

### 3. **Proper Movement Validation**
Each movement function now properly validates before moving:

- **moveLeft()**: Checks collision at `(x-1, y)` before moving
- **moveRight()**: Checks collision at `(x+1, y)` before moving  
- **moveDown()**: Checks collision at `(x, y+1)` before moving

### 4. **Safe Piece Placement**
When placing pieces on the board, we ensure we only place blocks that are within the visible board area:

```javascript
placePiece() {
    for (let row = 0; row < this.currentPiece.shape.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < this.currentPiece.shape[row].length; col++) {
            if (this.currentPiece.shape[row][col]) {
                const boardY = this.currentY + row;
                const boardX = this.currentX + col;
                if (boardY >= 0) {  // Only place if within visible board
                    this.board[boardY][boardX] = this.currentPiece.color;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Collision Issues Fixed

1. **Pieces going through walls**: Fixed by proper boundary checking
2. **Pieces overlapping existing blocks**: Fixed by checking `this.board[newY][newX]`
3. **Rotation failing near edges**: Fixed with wall kick system
4. **Game crashes when spawning**: Fixed by checking `newY >= 0` before board access
5. **Pieces not stopping at bottom**: Fixed by proper bottom boundary detection (`newY >= this.boardHeight`)

## How to Test

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Use arrow keys to move pieces
3. Use up arrow to rotate
4. Use space bar for hard drop
5. Try rotating pieces near edges - they should wall kick properly
6. Pieces should stop properly at boundaries and existing blocks

The collision detection now works correctly for all piece movements, rotations, and placements.
