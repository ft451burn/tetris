# Tetris Game with Advanced Collision Detection

## Overview
This is a complete Tetris implementation with **robust collision detection**, **comprehensive rotation handling**, and **extensive testing capabilities**. The game was specifically designed to address collision and overlap issues that commonly occur in Tetris implementations.

## Key Features

### üîÑ Super Rotation System (SRS)
- **Wall kick implementation** following official Tetris guidelines
- **Separate kick tables** for I-pieces and JLSTZ pieces
- **Multi-step kick attempts** to find valid rotation positions
- **Graceful rotation failure** when no valid position exists

### üß™ Comprehensive Testing Framework
- **Automated collision tests** covering all scenarios

## Collision Detection Improvements

### 1. Robust Boundary Checking
```javascript
// Check boundaries
if (boardX < 0 || boardX >= this.COLS || 
    boardY < 0 || boardY >= this.ROWS) {
    return true; // Collision detected
}
```

### 2. Accurate Rotation Detection
- Each piece has **4 precisely defined rotation states**
- Rotation attempts are validated **before** applying
- Wall kicks are attempted **systematically** using SRS data

### 3. Prevention of Overlapping
- **Every block position** is checked during collision detection
- **Existing board state** is considered for all movements
- **Multi-layer validation** ensures no piece can overlap

## Testing System

### Automated Tests
The game includes comprehensive automated tests that verify:

1. **Basic Collisions**
   - Floor collision detection
   - Wall collision detection (left/right)
   - Piece-to-piece collision detection

2. **Rotation Collisions**
   - All piece types in all rotation states
   - Rotation attempts near walls and obstacles
   - Wall kick system functionality

3. **Boundary Conditions**
   - Edge of board testing for all pieces
   - Corner case scenarios
   - Tight space rotations

4. **Complex Scenarios**
   - Multiple piece interactions
   - Cramped board conditions
   - Edge case positioning

### Interactive Testing
Use the test panel in the game interface:
- **"Run Tests"** - Execute all collision detection tests
- **"Rotation Sim"** - Simulate rotations at various positions
- **"Clear"** - Clear test results display

## Game Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ‚Üê ‚Üí | Move piece left/right |
| ‚Üì | Soft drop (faster fall) |
| ‚Üë | Rotate piece |
| Space | Hard drop (instant fall) |
| P | Pause/Resume game |

## Technical Implementation Details

### Collision Detection Algorithm
```javascript
checkCollision(piece, deltaX, deltaY, newRotation) {
    const newX = piece.x + deltaX;
    const newY = piece.y + deltaY;
    const shape = piece.shape[newRotation !== undefined ? newRotation : piece.rotation];
    
    for (let row = 0; row < shape.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < shape[row].length; col++) {
            if (shape[row][col]) {
                const boardX = newX + col;
                const boardY = newY + row;
                
                // Boundary check
                if (boardX < 0 || boardX >= this.COLS || 
                    boardY < 0 || boardY >= this.ROWS) {
                    return true;
                }
                
                // Board collision check
                if (this.board[boardY] && this.board[boardY][boardX]) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Wall Kick System
The game implements the Super Rotation System (SRS) with specific kick tables:

- **I-piece kicks**: Specialized for the 4-block line piece
- **JLSTZ kicks**: Standard kicks for other pieces
- **O-piece**: No kicks needed (square shape)

### Piece Definitions
All pieces are defined with precise 4x4 rotation matrices:

```javascript
T: {
    shape: [
        [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]], // 0¬∞
        [[0,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0]], // 90¬∞
        [[0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0]], // 180¬∞
        [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]  // 270¬∞
    ],
    color: 3
}
```

## Verified Scenarios

The collision system has been tested against these common problem scenarios:

‚úÖ **T-piece rotation near blocks** - No overlap occurs
‚úÖ **I-piece rotation at board edges** - Proper boundary detection
‚úÖ **L/J piece corner rotations** - Wall kicks work correctly
‚úÖ **Piece stacking** - No pieces can overlap when dropped
‚úÖ **Edge case rotations** - All boundaries properly respected

## Performance
- **Optimized collision detection** with early exit conditions
- **Efficient rotation checking** using pre-calculated matrices
- **Minimal computational overhead** for real-time gameplay

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Use keyboard controls to play
3. Click "Run Tests" to verify collision detection
4. Click "Rotation Sim" to see rotation behavior analysis

## Testing Results Expected

When running the collision tests, you should see results like:
```
‚úì Floor collision detection
‚úì Left wall collision detection  
‚úì Right wall collision detection
‚úì Piece-to-piece collision detection
‚úì I rotation 0‚Üí1 in open space
‚úì T rotation near wall handled correctly
‚úì Wall kick system working
...
```

A properly functioning system should achieve **90%+** test success rate.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter collision issues:

1. **Run the automated tests** to identify specific problems
2. **Check the browser console** for detailed test results
3. **Use the rotation simulator** to analyze piece behavior
4. **Verify piece definitions** in the tetromino matrices

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- Hold piece functionality
- T-spin detection and scoring
- Multi-level preview (showing multiple next pieces)
- Ghost piece animation improvements
- Sound effects and visual feedback

**Note**: This implementation prioritizes **correctness over speed**. The collision detection system is designed to be **bulletproof** rather than ultra-fast, ensuring no overlapping pieces can ever occur.
